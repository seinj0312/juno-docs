# Official Delegations Handbook

A Juno network validator may qualify for official delegations to be assigned by the core development reserve.&#x20;

New delegation rounds happen every 6 months and are assigned/ re-assigned based on the criteria listed below.&#x20;

A validator does not need to request delegations. Instead the core-1 team will screen the entire set 2 weeks prior to a new delegation round.&#x20;

Criteria are ranked either High, Medium or Low which indicates how each category is weighted. A validator may fulfill several of the criteria and therefore get a higher official delegation.&#x20;

Once a 6 month delegation round ends, the delegations are removed and reassigned based on the core criteria.&#x20;

The highest weight is allocated to dapp/contract development, core network development contributions & on-chain governance participation.&#x20;

The vision is for Juno validators to be active participants especially on the smart contract front as that is the core specialization of the Juno Hub.

## Official delegation criteria

1. Dapp / Contract / Tooling Development (High Priority)
2. Continuous active participation in the Juno ecosystem chats (Medium Priority)
3. A validator node must be live on main-net for at least 1 month to qualify.
4. Validators inside the top 10 do not qualify for official delegations.
5. A validators commission should not exceed 10%
6. Active participation in on-chain governance (High Priority)
7. A validator may curate/manage a regional community chat with at least 100 members (Medium Priority)
8. Relayer operations for the full duration of a delegation round. (Medium Priority)
9. A validator that gets soft-slashed more than 1 time during a delegation round loses his/her official delegation.
10. A validator that gets hard-slashed 1 time during a delegation round loses his/her official delegation.
11. Core development work on the main code base (High Priority)
12. Validator min gas price must be set equal to or greater than 0.0025ujuno
13. A validator that is white-labelled, operates a revenue split, or is not run wholly by the team applying for the delegation is ineligible for a delegation

Note: A new 6 month delegation round is announced in the official channels on Discord & Telegram many weeks prior to kickoff.

The next delegation round will be assigned on July 1st 2022. The evaluation period starts 2 weeks prior.
